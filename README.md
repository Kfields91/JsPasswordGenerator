# JsPasswordGenerator

This readMe is still being created. The project goal is to create a random password using user imput gather from prompts/confirms. The password must be a minimum length of 8 characters and a maximum length of 128. It must be verified whether or not the user would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or special characters in their password options.

Currently my program is creating random variables and the correct number the user chooses while displaying that on the screen.

Missing a couple of important things

- better randomization of possileCharacters missing a loop?
- missing between 8 and 128 characters specifications
- options for when they choose not to include an option(s) with many if/else statements

I have failed to commit enough along the way to see my progress however my plan is to make comments in my javascript file to explain my journey.

The projects status:

- a work in progress.
